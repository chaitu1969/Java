 LinkedList
	-> Linked lists provide efficient dynamic memory allocation, making them well-suited for situations where the size 
	of the data structure needs to be constantly changing. This is because linked lists allow for efficient insertion 
	and deletion of elements at any position within the list without requiring the entire structure to be resized or 
	moved.
